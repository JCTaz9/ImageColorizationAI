# ImageColorizationAI
Final Project of COMP3065 (HKBU)

## Overview

This repository hosts code designed for colorization tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch, aiming to convert grayscale images into their vibrant, colorful counterparts. Users have the flexibility to apply the code to their own images or explore its capabilities with the included sample dataset.
